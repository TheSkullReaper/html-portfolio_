<h1>The Best Movies According to Zach</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-Time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Iron Man 1, 2, and 3</h3>
<p>I loved the way it shows what he went through and the fact that he learns from all of his mistakes. In the first one he starts off very cocky but then towards the end he is somewhat humble</p>

<h3>Four Brothers</h3>
<p>I love the way it shows how no matter what, given the same circumstances, the same opportunities, the same everything, people make their own choices. It shows that you dont have to be blood to be family. Also, it shows how bad things happen to good people</p>

<h3>The Punisher</h3>
<p>The movie is about getting vengeance for his family. The way it shows how a man will stop at nothing to get the ones who wronged his family.</p>

<h2>My Top 3 TV Shows of All-Time</h2>

<H3>Arrow</h3>
<p>I love the way he was in the first few seasons where it was all about righting his fathers wrongs, and it eventually launches the 'Arrowverse'.</p>

<h3>The Flash</h3>
<p>It shows that even when the most gruesome thing can happen in your life, you still have to rise above and be a Hero.</p>

<h3>Supergirl</h3>
<p>I love that it shows that even though she has all of the same exact powers of superman, it shows her struggling with learning how to control them. It goes to show that no matter how powerful you are, it does not matter unless you know how to control it and yourself.</p>
